were slightly more positive and more negative, but had slightly lower neutral 
scores than Ethereum article texts.  The average Bitcoin positive, negative, 
and neutral scores were 0.079, 0.038, and 0.883, respectively.  The average 
Ethereum positive, negative, and neutral scores were 0.071, 0.032, and 0.897, 
respectively.  Furthermore, Bitcoin’s mean compound score of 0.190 was slightly 
higher than Ethereum’s mean compound score (0.163).

On an individual text level, a Bitcoin text had the highest positive rating out 
of all Bitcoin and Ethereum texts—0.326.  Additionally, an Ethereum text had 
the highest overall negative sentiment score—0.347.  Ethereum’s average 
negative score was slightly lower than Bitcoin’s average negative score, so it 
appears there is a certain amount of skew present in Ethereum’s negative scores.
